# MandelbrotBrowser

### About
A simple mandelbrot set viewer. 

### Overview
This application provides a visual means of displaying the Mandelbrot set.
More info on the set can be found here: [Wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mandelbrot_set).

This project was created mainly as a fun way of familiarising myself with some basic C# imaging techniques (bitmaps, mouse movements, etc). 

### Todo
Some improvements to the algorithm has been done, but the application as a whole could still be improved.

- Colour
 - Add more palette choices
 - Use the _smoother_ colour transition algorithm

- Use `async`/`await` to stop blocking
  _note, that this is will not improve performance!_

- Ability to save image

- Ability to save/load configuration

- Ability to stop/pause/continue rendering

- Increase performance via multi-threading ??
